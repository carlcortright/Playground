# Compound expressions
z = begin a=1; b=2; a+b end
x = (a=1; b=2; a+b)

# Conditionals
x=2
y=3
if x < y
  println("x is less than y")
end

# Note: Variables introducted in if statements will stay in scope after execution

#
# Tests a basic if-statement
#
function controlTest(x,y)
  # Note: julia returns the return value of the last executed statement from an if
  z = if x < y
    println("x is less than y")
  elseif x > y
    println("y is greater than x")
  else
    println("x equals y")
  end
  println(z)
end
controlTest(2,1)

# Note: Julia only takes true or false as arguments to conditional statements
# Note: Julia has short-circuit evaluation for && and ||

# While loops
i = 1
while i<=5
  println(i)
  i += 1
end

# For loops
# 1:5 is a range
for i = 1:5
  println(i)
end

for i in range(1,5)
  println(i)
end

# A cool way to write that ^
for i âˆˆ range(1,5)
  println(i)
end

# Testing a break statement
while i < 20
  if i === 10
    break
  end
  i += 1
end
println(i)


for i = 1:10
   if i % 3 != 0
    #  continue moves us to the next iteration
     continue
   end
   println(i)
 end

# Julia will nest loops over multiple ranges
for i=1:2, j=2:8
  println("i=$i j=$j")
end

# Playing with exceptions
type weirderror <: Exception end
f(x) = x >= 0 ? exp(-x) : throw(DomainError)
f(1)

# Error stops execution immediately
fuzzy_sqrt(x) = x >= 0 ? sqrt(x) : error("x must be positive")
fuzzy_sqrt(1)
warn("we are plaing with errors")
info("here's some extra info to help you diagnose what's happening")

function g(x)
  try
    sqrt(x)
  catch
    sqrt(complex(x,0))
  end
end
println(g(1))
println(g(-1))

# Try-catch statements will also save the type of error to a variable.
try
  sqrt(-1)
catch y
  if isa(y, DomainError)
    println("Found the problem")
  end
end

# Julia also includes finally blocks
try
  sqrt(-1)
catch
  println("handling the exception")
finally
  println("executing the finally")
end

# Using tasks to solve the producer/consumer problem
function producer()
  produce("start")
  for i in 1:4
    produce(i)
  end
  produce("end")
end
p = Task(producer)
c = ""
while c != "end"
  c = consume(p)
  println(c)
end
# A task is also an interable object
for x in Task(producer)
  println(x)
end

# This is all pretty powerful, but in reality, both produce and consume use
# yeildto() to avoid race conditions and implement monitor-like behavior
